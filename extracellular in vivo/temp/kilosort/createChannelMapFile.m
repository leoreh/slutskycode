% kcoords is used to forcefully restrict templates to channels in the same
% channel group. An option can be set in the master_file to allow a fraction 
% of all templates to span more channel groups, so that they can capture shared 
% noise across all channels. This option is

% ops.criterionNoiseChannels = 0.2; 

% if this number is less than 1, it will be treated as a fraction of the total number of clusters

% if this number is larger than 1, it will be treated as the "effective
% number" of channel groups at which to set the threshold. So if a template
% occupies more than this many channel groups, it will not be restricted to
% a single channel group.
